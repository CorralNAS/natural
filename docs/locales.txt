locales
=======

Natural uses locales for translating most textual output using gettext_. We
need your help translating the project!

Adding a new language
---------------------

If your favourite language is not yet supported, you can help out by
translation natural into your language! The most convenient way is to get a
GitHub_ account and fork `the project`_, but patches are also welcome.

If you want to help out using GitHub_, fork the project. Let's assume your
GitHub_ username is ``acme`` and the language you want to add it ``ru_RU``::

    ~$ git clone git@github.com:acme/natural.git
    ~$ cd natural
    natural$ make ru_RU.po
    Created locale/ru_RU.po.

Now fire up your favourite editor, and start translating the strings located
in ``locale/ru_RU.po``. If you are not sure how to translate certain bits, you
can leave it blank for somebody else to translate.

If you are done editing and verified you are satisfied with the results, you
may now generate the message catalog::

    natural$ make ru_RU.mo
    Compiling natural/locale/ru_RU/LC_MESSAGES/natural.mo
    natural$ git add .
    natural$ git commit -a -m 'Added Russian translations'
    [master (commit) beefbad] Added Russian translations
     0 files changed
     create mode 100644 locale/ru_RU.po
     create mode 100644 natural/locale/ru_RU/LC_MESSAGES/natural.mo

Finally, push your changes to GitHub_::

    natural$ git push origin master
    Counting objects: 2, done.
    Delta compression using up to 2 threads.
    Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (2/2), 2400 bytes, done.
    Total 2 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To git@github.com:tehmaze/natural.git
       2342bah..beefbad  master -> master

Now you are ready to open a ``pull request`` on GitHub. If you do not wish to
get a GitHub_ account, you can also pull the changes and send the diff::

    ~$ git clone https://github.com/tehmaze/natural.git
    ~$ cd natural
    natural$ make ru_RU.po
    Created locale/ru_RU.po.
    natural$ $EDITOR locale/ru_RU.po
    natural$ make ru_RU.mo
    Compiling natural/locale/ru_RU/LC_MESSAGES/natural.mo
    natural$ git add .
    natural$ git diff --no-prefix --binary HEAD~1 HEAD > ru_RU.patch

Now you can send the natural author ``ru_RU.patch``.

Updating a language
-------------------

Get a copy of the repository as described in the previous topic. After that,
generate a fresh copy of the translation pot::

    natural$ make translate-extract
    Extracting gettext to locale/natural.pot
    natural$ make nl_NL.po         
    Merging locale/nl_NL.po: ........... done.
    natural$ $EDITOR locale/nl_NL.po
    natural$ make nl_NL.mo
    Compiling natural/locale/nl_NL/LC_MESSAGES/natural.mo
