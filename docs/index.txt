Welcome to Natural's documentation!
===================================

Natural is a Python library to easily transform data into human-readable
formats such as dates, time differences, numbers and sizes.

Features:

 * Natural is not using any third-party libraries, so it runs from a bare Python installation

 * Natural is fully internationalised and speaks `your language`_

 * Natural is PEP8_ compliant

 * Natural has an extensive `test suite`_

.. _your language: https://github.com/tehmaze/natural/wiki/translate
.. _PEP8: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
.. _test suite: http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/


Demo::

    >>> from natural import date, number, size
    >>> import datetime
    >>> date.compress(datetime.datetime(2012, 01, 01, 23, 42))
    u'23w2d17h52m59s'
    >>> number.word(2300000)
    u'2.3 million'
    >>> size.filesize(102410241024)
    u'95.377 GB'


We speak `your language`_ too!


    >>> import locale
    >>> locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'de_DE')
    >>> from natural import date
    >>> date.timedelta(1337000000)
    'vor 4 Wochen'
